Wash

* Scrape out any food remains / pour away excess liquid
* Rinse the container ( use your washing-up water )
* Donâ€™t put recyclate in the dishwasher - no need to waste resources to achieve an unnecessary level of cleanliness

Squash

* Crush metal cans.
* Squeeze plastic bottles flat to expel as much air as possible

Dry

* Make sure it is dry!

Labels

* No need to remove them as the recycling process settles it
